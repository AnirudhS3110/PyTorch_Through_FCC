# Linear Regression

## Functions Learnt:

### torch.optim.SGD(params, lr="") , this function helps to automatically update the weights of the edges, no need to manually update the weights using with torch.no_grad()

### torch.nn is a base which has predefined models, we customize these models for ourselves by code

### we can use  '?' + the function name to know about the function

### DataLoader from torch.utils.data , this helps to divide the whole data set into batches of predefined size.

### TensorDataSet from torch.utils.data , this helps to view teh tensors as tuples.


### .parameters() -> Returns list of Matrices associated with the model (both weight matrices and Bias matrix)
